# computer_science_basics

This repository gives an overview over some programming languages and certain theoretical concepts of computer sciences.

The documents for the languages are intended to give a brief overview over the covered languages for a quick start when using a language just from time to time. On the other hand, they include some hints for using certain features of the languages that one may not use in the daily life and therefore may need to look up from time to time.
